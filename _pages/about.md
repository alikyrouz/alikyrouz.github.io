I am currently an undergraduate at Wellesley College. I am interested in interdisciplinary possibilities in the intersection of computer science and the humanities, including computational humanities as well as alternative applications of literary theory. 

During my senior year at Wellesley, I am composing an Honors thesis in the English Department considering the role of the speaker in Romantic lyric poetry alongside contemporary relationships to text produced by generative AI. 

In the rest of my time, I enjoy exploring the Spotify API, and working on any project that lets me make some graphs.
